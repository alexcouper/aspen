    Support Multiple FS Layouts
========================================

We want to extend Aspen to support multiple filesystem layouts.

First, look for {aspen,apps,handlers,middleware}.conf on ASPENCONFPATH, which
defaults to:

    /usr/local/etc/aspen:/usr/etc/aspen:/etc/aspen:.

Multiple conf files on ASPENCONFPATH override each other in the order
encountered. This covers "scattered" UNIX-type layouts, where Aspen is installed
integrally with a UNIX-style operating system.

Then, look for and at most one of these (first match wins):

    <conf file specified on the command line> as args[2]
    ./etc/aspen.conf

Where neither of these two exist, aspen.paths.root must be set as 'root' in the
[paths] section of aspen.conf. Where one or the other exists, aspen.paths.root
is set to the current working directory. @@: What about var (which should be in
paths)? __?

    $ aspen conf -- print out the sources of configuration

@@: How does this relate to a conf file preprocessor? Do we support both
overriding and preprocessing? What are the specific cases and details of each?

@@: What about Windows layouts? Deal with that w/ Windows service iteration.
